# Thursday, May 4 #

#### 8:00AM - 9:00AM Bring your own data

#### Session 3 9:00AM - 10:30AM tidyverse : data wrangling pt. 1 (Tsung-Heng Tsai) ####

- Introduction to tidy data
    + What is tidy data?
    + Why tidy data?
    + Examples of non-tidy (messy) datasets
- Tidying messy data with tidyr
- Data manipulation and transformation with dplyr
    + Manipulation and transformation on one dataset

#### 10:30AM - 11:00AM Break

#### 11:00AM - 12:30PM tidyverse : data wrangling pt. 2 (Tsung-Heng Tsai) ####

- Data manipulation and transformation with dplyr (cont.)
    + Make grouped summaries with summary functions
    + Merge datasets
- Two tasks for the case study
    + Normalization by equalizing medians across runs
    + Summarization of feature intensities
- Grouped summaries with arbitrary operations
    + List-column
    
#### 12:30PM - 1:30PM Lunch

#### Session 5 1:30PM - 3:00PM tidyverse : modeling (Tsung-Heng Tsai) ####

- Example: using a for loop to make grouped summaries
    + Loop over proteins
    + Fit a linear model
    + Extract information from model object and combine the results
- Methods for better solution 
    + Tidying methods for model objects
    + List-columns
- General workflow with nested data frames
    + `nest`
    + `map`
    + `unnest`
    
#### 3:00PM - 3:30PM Break

#### Session 6 3:30PM - 4:15PM Functions (Jan Vitek) ####

- Basics: what is a function and why would you write one?
- How to write a function
- Parts of a function
    + Formals
    + Body
    + Environment
- Example: writing a function
    + Rewrite a previous example (from case study?) as a function
- Function arguments
    + Default and missing arguments
    + Lazy evaluation
- Returning values: implicit, `return()`, `invisible()`
- John Chambers: "To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:"
    + *Everything that exists is an object*
    + *Everything that happens is a function call*
- Example: `+` and `-`, etc., are also functions, can be redefined
- Infix functions, creating a user-defined `%plus%`, etc.
- How to write good functions

#### Session 7 4:15PM - 5:00PM Functional programming (Jan Vitek) ####

- Motivation, showing problem w/ repetitive copy-paste solution (what problem?)
- Functionals: `lapply` and family
- Example: better solution to problem using `lapply`
- More examples:
    + `sapply`
    + `tapply`
    + `vapply`
    + `apply`
    + etc.
- Anonymous functions
- Closures
- When to use a loop vs. functional
